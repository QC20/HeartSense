# How the 12 Neopixel Ring Works

The "WS2812" is one type of programmable RGB LED. It is sold in the form of bars, rings, strips or individual LEDs. It allows you to create an infinite number of colorful effects. The common name for these LEDs is NeoPixel. This is because Adafruit was the first company to write a library to control them and call it NeoPixel.


This subfolder includes example code demonstrating the functionality of the NeoPixel. It provides a starting point for using this device to creatively visualize human heartbeat data through single-color pixel intensity and brightness.
