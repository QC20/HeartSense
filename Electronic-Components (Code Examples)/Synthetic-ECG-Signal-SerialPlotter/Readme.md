# Simulating EKG Signal Output

This code snippet simulates the output of an Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) signal by printing a predefined array of EKG values to the Serial Monitor. The ekg array contains 100 samples representing an EKG waveform. The values are printed with a 10 ms delay between each print, mimicking real-time EKG signal behavior.

How to Use:
1. Upload the code to your Arduino or microcontroller (MCU) board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Ctrl+Shift+M or Tools -> Serial Monitor).
3. Set the baud rate to 115200.
4. Observe the simulated EKG values printed one by one.

This code is useful for testing how your Arduino/MCU processes EKG data or for simulating EKG signals in various projects. You can also modify the delay or array values to suit your specific needs.
