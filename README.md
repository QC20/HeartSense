# HeartSense Indicator Using ECG

## Overview
HeartSense is an interactive LED ring that visually represents your heartbeats in real-time. The LED ring blinks to your heartbeats and displays the current BPM (beats per minute) using both numerical values and color-coded illumination.

## Features
- Real-time heart rate monitoring using ECG.
- LED ring that blinks in sync with your heartbeat.
- Displays BPM with color-coded LED illumination.
- Affective computing elements that visually convey heart rate changes.

## Components
- ECG sensor
- LED ring
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Power supply
- Connecting wires and resistors

## Installation
