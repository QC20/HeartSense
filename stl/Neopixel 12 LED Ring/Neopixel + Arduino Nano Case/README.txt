Neopixel + Arduino Nano Case by DrNerd on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4841666

Summary
So I created this before I discovered Arafruit already has some neat sew-in diffusers uploaded (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:225574).  But now having built a few of these and have them work out pretty well, I thought I'd post it.  Fits Adafruit's Flora NeoPixel module.

Object likely only works on Formlabs type printer.  Got some small holes for sewing that I don't think FDM type printers will be able to reproduce.  Need pretty fine pitch to reproduce.

Used this for glowing eyes on a costume.  Worked a treat.
